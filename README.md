# Zero Hunger

We require a system to automate and monitor our operations. As an NGO dedicated to providing meals for underprivileged individuals and children, we've identified a significant amount of food wastage in Dhaka city, particularly from office events and buffets. Our mission is to repurpose this surplus food. We've initiated partnerships with several restaurants, and they have agreed to donate excess food before it expires or to preserve it until we can pick it up. We currently have a team of employees, with ongoing recruitment.

The workflow is as follows:

1. Restaurants will initiate a collection request from their dashboard, specifying the maximum duration they can preserve the food.
2. We will accept the collection request and assign an employee to retrieve the food.
3. Once collected, our employee will distribute the food, and upon completion, the collection request will be marked as finished.

The system should also track all collection requests and their details.
